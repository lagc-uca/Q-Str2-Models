# Q-Str2-Models
"Q-Str2-Models" is a plugin for QGIS developed under the “PyQGIS”. It allows us to obtain in a semi-automated way the values resulting from the maximum geodetic strain, shear deformation, rotation and dilatation in geodynamically active areas, from the horizontal velocities (East, North) of a series of GNSS stations.
