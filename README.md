# Q-Str2-Models
"Q-Str2-Models" (Strain-Stress App) is a complementary software for QGIS developed under the “PyQGIS” API of the Python language, it is published under the free software license GPL, it allows us to obtain in a semi-automated way the values resulting from the maximum geodetic strain, shear deformation, rotation and dilatation in geodynamically active areas, from the horizontal velocities (East, North) of a series of GNSS stations (points), also allows us to create Stress-strain tensors from of a regular grid.
